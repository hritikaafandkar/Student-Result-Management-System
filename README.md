2.2	System Planning and Schedule
2.2.1S/W development Model
	Spiral model is one of the most important Software Development Life Cycle models, which provides support for Risk Handling. In its diagrammatic representation, it looks like a spiral with many loops. The exact number of loops of the spiral is unknown and can vary from project to project. Each loop of the spiral is called a Phase of the software development process. The exact number of phases needed to develop the product can be varied by the project manager depending upon the project risks. As the project manager dynamically determines the number of phases, so the project manager has an important role to develop a product using the spiral model. 
The Spiral model can be effectively utilized for developing a student result management system, particularly in situations where there is a high level of risk and uncertainty involved. Here's how the Spiral model can be applied in the development process:
1.	Identification and Planning: In the first phase, the objectives, requirements, and constraints of the student result management system are identified. This includes understanding the desired features, performance expectations, security requirements, and integration needs. A preliminary plan is created, outlining the goals, resources, and major risks associated with the project.
2.	Risk Analysis and Evaluation: The second phase focuses on analyzing and evaluating potential risks and uncertainties associated with the development of the system. This includes identifying potential issues such as data security vulnerabilities, scalability challenges, or integration complexities. Risk mitigation strategies are devised to address these challenges.
3.	Development and Testing: In this phase, the development and testing of the student result management system take place. The development is performed iteratively, with each iteration resulting in an increment of the system. The developed features are tested rigorously to ensure functionality, accuracy, and performance. Feedback is gathered from stakeholders and users to refine the system in subsequent iterations.
4.	Review and Evaluation: After each development iteration, a review and evaluation of the system are conducted. This includes assessing the progress made, analyzing the feedback received, and identifying areas for improvement. This evaluation helps in determining the next steps, such as whether to proceed with further iterations, make adjustments to the requirements, or update the project plan.
5.	Planning the Next Iteration: Based on the evaluation, the next iteration is planned. This involves revisiting the identified risks, updating the project plan, and refining the requirements. The planning phase also includes determining the scope of the upcoming iteration and setting priorities for the development tasks.
6.	Iterative Development and Refinement: The development and refinement process continues in subsequent iterations. Each iteration builds upon the previous one, addressing identified risks and incorporating feedback from stakeholders. The system is continuously enhanced and refined until it meets the desired functionality, performance, and quality standards.

3.2.2Object Oriented Analysis & Design Diagrams
	UML Diagram
	UML is an acronym that stands for Unified Modeling Language. Simply put, UML is a modern approach to modeling and documenting software. In fact, it’s one of the most popular business process modeling techniques. By using visual representations, we are able to better understand possible flaws or errors in software or business processes.
There` are two types of UML diagrams
1.	Structural diagrams :  show the things in the modeled system. In a more technical term, they show different objects in a system. 
•	Eg . Class Diagram
•	Component Diagram
2.	Behavioral diagrams : show what should happen in a system. They describe how the objects interact with each other to create a functioning system.
•	Eg. Use Case Diagram
•	Activity Diagram
•	Sequence Diagram

3.2.2.1 Use Case Diagram 
A use diagram is a graphic depiction of the interactions among the elements of a system. A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify and organize system requirements. The actors, usually individual involved with the system defined according to their roles.
Notations : 
Actor: A role that a user plays with respect to the system, including human users and other systems. 
Use Case: A set of scenarios that describing an interaction between a user and a system, including alternatives. 
System Boundary: A Rectangle diagram representing the boundary between the actors and the system. A box that sets a system scope to use cases. All use cases outside the box would be considered outside the scope of that system.
Association: An association is a connection (communication) between an actor and a use case.
Include: The include relationship occurs when a chunk of behavior is similar across more than one use case. 
Extend: The extending use case may add behavior to the base use case. The base class declares “extension points”.

3.2.2.2 Class Diagram 
In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.
Notations : 
1.	ClassName:-  class-name is required to be drawn only in the representation of a class graphically.
2.	Attributes:- An attribute is named property of a class which describes the object being modeled. In the class diagram, this component is placed just below the name -compartment.
3.	Operations:- Operations are shown in the 3rd partition. they are services the class provides.
4.	Multiplicity:- It defines how many attributes instances can be created if any class is implemented. Default multiplicity can be considered as one.
5.	Aggregation:-A special type of association. It represents a “Part of” relationship.
Composition:-A special type of aggreagtion where parts are destroyed when the whole is destroyed.

3.2.2.3 Sequence Diagram 
Admin’s
Student’s
Sequence Diagrams are interaction diagrams that detail how operations are carried out. They capture the interaction between objects in the context of a collaboration. Sequence Diagrams are time focus and they show the order of the interaction visually by using the vertical axis of the diagram to represent time what messages are sent and when.
Notations : 
1.	Actor :- represent roles played by human users, external hardware, or other subjects.
2.	Lifeline :- A lifeline represents an individual participant in the Interaction.
3.	Activations :- A thin rectangle on a lifeline) represents the period during which an element is performing an operation.
Message:- A message defines a particular communication between Lifelines of an Interaction.

3.2.2.4 Flowchart/ER diagram
A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm. They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. Flowcharts, sometimes spelled as flow charts, use rectangles, ovals, diamonds and potentially numerous other shapes to define the type of step, along with connecting arrows to define flow and sequence. They can range from simple, hand-drawn charts to comprehensive computer-drawn diagrams depicting multiple steps and routes. If we consider all the various forms of flowcharts, they are one of the most common diagrams on the planet, used by both technical and non-technical people in numerous fields. Flowcharts are sometimes called by more specialized names such as Process Flowchart, Process Map, Functional Flowchart, Business Process Mapping, Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN),  or Process Flow Diagram (PFD). They are related to other popular diagrams, such as Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity Diagrams
ER diagram
An Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) is a representation of data within a domain.It consists of entities as well as relationships between entities.
Notations : 
1.	Entity:- Entities are represented by means of rectangles. Rectangles are named with the entity set they represent.
2.	Attributes:-Attributes are the properties of entities. Attributes are represented by means of ellipses. 
3.	Multivalued attributes are depicted by double ellipse.
4.	Derived attributes are depicted by dashed ellipse.
5.	Relationships are represented by diamond-shaped box.

# Testing
4.1	Methodologies used for testing
	System testing is a critical element of software quality assurance and represents the ultimate review of specification, design and coding. Software testing fundamentals define the overriding objectives for software testing. Testing is one of the steps in the software engineering process that could be viewed (psychologically, at least) as destructive rather than constructive. Testing is a process of executing a program with the intent of finding an error. A good test case is one that has a high probability of finding a yet undiscovered error. A successful test is one that uncovers an as yet undiscovered error.
●	User Acceptance Testing or Beta Testing
Functional Requirement	User Acceptance	Status
System should allow users to login themselves	System allow users to login	Pass
System should allow the user to update the data 	System allows users to update the data	Pass
System should allow the user to print the data	System allows the user to print the data	Pass

4.2	Black Box Testing
Black box testing is a technique of software testing which examines the functionality of software without peering into its internal structure or coding. The primary source of black box testing is a specification of requirements that is stated by the customer
